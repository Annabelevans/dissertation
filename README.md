Stata code I wrote for my dissertation entitled "The Impact of a Third Child on Mother's Home and Labour Production". 
The "Lippmann et al (2020) replication" file shows the code I used to replicate Table D1 in the Appendix of the paper "Undoing Gender with Institutions: Lessons from the German Division and Reunification" by Lippmann et al (2020). 
The data comes from the German Socio-Economic Panel using all the waves from 1991-2012. 
The "Angrist and Evans (1998) replication" file shows the code I used to replicate Table 2 and Table 6 from the paper "Children and Their Parents' Labour Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Changes in Family Size" by Angrist and Evans (1998). 
The data I used was from the 2021 1% American Community Survey (ACS) by IPUMS (whereas Angrist and Evans' paper used data from 1980 and 1990).
